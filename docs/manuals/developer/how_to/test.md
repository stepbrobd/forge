# How to test

## How to test the UI

### Basic test

Run basic tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/):

```bash
dev-ui

test-ui --project=chromium
```

::: {note}
`test-ui` is a shell wrapper around `playwright test -c ui/tests/e2e` without
any extra arguments forwarded to that command.

:::

### Advanced test configuration

- Run tests only using specific browser

```bash
test-ui --project=chromium
test-ui --project=firefox --project=mobile
```

- Run tests with a single worker

```bash
test-ui -j 1
```

- Open the playwright web UI to iterate on the tests

```bash
test-ui --ui
test-ui --ui-host 127.0.0.1
```

- Run the tests using Forge production instance

```bash
env BASE_URL="https://ngi-nix.github.io/forge/" test-ui --ui-host 127.0.0.1
```

### Notes

- Always use `data-testid` HTML attributes for stable test selectors.
