    Ziplinter reads a ZIP archive and outputs detailed metadata about its contents as JSON.

    #### Example

    Run ziplinter against a ZIP file

    ```
    ziplinter archive.zip
    ```

    The output is a JSON object with a `"contents"` key listing all archived files along
    with their compression method, sizes, and other metadata.
