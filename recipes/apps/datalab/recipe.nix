      DataLab is an open-source platform for scientific signal and image processing and visualization.
      It can be used as a standalone application, embedded in your own software, or remote-controlled via its XML-RPC API.

      #### GUI

      First, [enter the Nix shell](app/datalab#run-shell), then launch the DataLab desktop application:

      ```bash
      datalab
      ```

      Or, for an automated demonstration of some of DataLab's features, run:

      ```bash
      datalab-demo
      ```

      #### API

      First, [enter the Nix shell](app/datalab#run-shell), which provides a Python environment with DataLab already installed.

      In the example below, we use a [remote proxy](https://datalab-platform.com/en/features/advanced/proxy.html#module-datalab.control.proxy) to programmatically create and display some data.

      Second, start the DataLab GUI (which also launches its XML-RPC server):

      ```bash
      datalab >/dev/null &
      ```

      Third, run the following script:

      ```python
      # test.py
      ${lib.readFile ./test.py}
      ```

      ```bash
      python ./test.py
      ```

      Lastly, navigate to the DataLab GUI and you should find `my-signal` in the Signal Panel and `my-image` in the Image Panel.

      For more scripting examples, please refer to the [API documentation](https://datalab-platform.com/en/features/advanced/proxy.html).
