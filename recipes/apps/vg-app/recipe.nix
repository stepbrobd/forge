    VG is a toolkit for working with genome variation graphs.
    It provides tools for mapping, calling, and manipulating variation graph representations of genomes.

    #### Examples

    The instructions below will use the `tiny` dataset of the [vg tests](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/tree/4cd46f212268f5d78a4dc42af22208e2be08d8a2/test), but feel free to experiment with other ones like `small` or `complex`.

    ##### Basic usage

    Construct a graph:

    ```bash
    vg construct -r tiny/x.fa -v tiny/x.vcf.gz > x.vg
    ```

    Index graph into a xg/gcsa pair:

    ```bash
    vg index -x x.xg -g x.gcsa -k 16 x.vg
    ```

    Convert graph to an image (e.g. using graphviz):

    ```bash
    vg view -d x.vg >x.dot
    dot -Tpng x.dot -o output.png
    ```
