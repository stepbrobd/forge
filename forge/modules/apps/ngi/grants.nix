/**
  Funding that software authors receive from NLnet to support various software
  projects. Each subgrant comes from a fund, which is in turn bound to a grant
  agreement with the European commission.

  We track: `Commons`, `Core`, `Entrust` and `Review`. While the first three
  are current fund themes, `Review` encompasses all non-current NGI funds (e.g.
  Assure, Discovery, PET, ...).

  See [NLnet - Thematics Funds](https://nlnet.nl/themes/) for more information.
